        <h2>Maybe you'll see...</h2>
        
        <ul class="list">
            
            <li>The vast Sea of Tranquility</li>
            <li>The first human extraterrestrial landing site</li>
            <li>The Earth rise over the moon's horizon</li>
            <li>The home base of the lizard people</li>

                <h3>Helium-3 (He3) mining:</h3>
                
                <p>Since the 2043 breakthrough in nuclear fusion, the Earthbound megacorps are in need of ever increasing amounts of He3!</p>
                <p>The prospector town of Caldera could always use more hardworking people like <strong>YOU</strong> to lend a hand in He3 harvesting. The beautiful otherworldly landscapes and the thriving sense of community are only the beginning - the satisfaction of a hard day's work in the technomines is outweighed only by the payout of such work.</p>
                <p>The average Helium-3 prospector makes enough money to buy their way out of birth-debt after only 3 years of work!!</p>
                
                <h3>Moon diamond mining</h3>
                
                <p>While much more scarce than the seemingly omnipresent He3, if you stumble upon even the smallest vein of moon diamonds, you will be living lavishly for the foreseeable future. If you happen across a <em>large</em> one, well, you and everyone you know for the next several generations will be living large.</p>
                <p>However, for the chance at heaping returns, there are two main trade-offs when compared to He3 mining:</p>
                <ul>
                    
                    <li>Danger</li>
                    <li>Isolation</li>
                    
                </ul>
            
                <h4>The danger:</h4>
                
                <p>The moon diamond mining business is extremely competitive and occasionally even violent. There have been reported cases of highway robbery and even murder in the excavation and transport of moon diamonds.</p>
                <p>On top of the (literally, at times) cutthroat business, the lizard people have a curious relationship with these diamonds and they have been known to attack or telekenetically dismantle the minds of any unlucky moon diamond miners that cross their paths with diamonds in hand.</p>
                
                <h4>The isolation</h4>
                
                <p>There is no sense of thriving community among the moon diamond miners. Their business is dangerous and trust is nearly non-existent between any two groups of diamond miners. Because of this, it is not uncommon for these folks to feel intense loneliness after long stretches of isolation.</p>
                
                <h3>Lizard thralls</h3>
                
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b3/Apollo_16_rocks.jpg/180px-Apollo_16_rocks.jpg" alt="A holo-node used to amplify telekenetic power of lizard people on the moon">
                
                <p>Has life got you down? Does every day feel like a drudgery of meaningless choices and hollow interactions? Well drudge no longer, because the lizard people want YOU!</p>
                
                <p>The Second Colony of the Lizards is in need of willing humans to tend their egg hatcheries and their bio-ship manufacturing plants. Of course, due to the intensely nauseating working environments and mentally scarring practices required to fulfill the needs of the hatcheries and bio-ship plants, the lizard people are kind enough to take the reins of your mind and set you on unconscious autopilot. With their advanced memory wipe technology, most people will end their tenure with the lizard people like they were never even there, and with a complete sense of rejuvination!</p>
                
                <p>On top of all that, the lizard people compensate very generously - five to seven years as a thrall (depending on your station) and you will have more than enough money to pay off your birth-debt! It is easy to understand why this option is by far the most popular choice for today's working stiffs. The real challenge, however, is making it through the application process.</p>
